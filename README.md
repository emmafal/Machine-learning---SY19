# Machine Learning - SY19  

This repository contains our project for the **SY19 Machine Learning** course, a final-year engineering course at **UTC (Université de Technologie de Compiègne)**. The course introduces the foundations of machine learning, an intersection field between artificial intelligence and statistics, with the goal of making sense of data.  

## Project Overview

As a component of the course, we also carried out a three-stage project in pairs to put into practice and enhance our skills in machine learning:

### **Phase 1: Regression Task**
We were given a regression dataset and were asked to make the best out of it with the in-class methods.

### **Phase 2: Classification Task**
We then worked on a classification dataset, optimizing performance using all the models covered in the course.

### **Phase 3: Independent Exploration**
For the final component, we selected a dataset from the internet to analyze and explore. We chose the **Medical Insurance Cost Prediction** dataset, available on Kaggle:
